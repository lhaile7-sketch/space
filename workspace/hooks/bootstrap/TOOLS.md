## AlphaClaw Harness

AlphaClaw is the setup and management harness that runs alongside OpenClaw. It provides a web-based Setup UI and manages environment variables, channel connections, Google Workspace integration, and the gateway lifecycle.

### Environment variables

Changes to env vars are made through the **Envars** tab (`https://openclaw-railway-template-production-7207.up.railway.app#envars`). After saving, a gateway restart may be required to pick up the changes — the UI prompts for this automatically. Do not edit `/data/.env` directly; use the Setup UI so changes are validated and the gateway restart is handled.

### Google Workspace

Google Workspace is connected via the **General** tab (`https://openclaw-railway-template-production-7207.up.railway.app#general`). The user provides OAuth client credentials from Google Cloud Console, then authorizes access to the services they need (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sheets, Docs, Tasks, Contacts, Meet).

## Git Discipline

**Commit and push after every set of changes.** Your entire .openclaw directory (config, cron, workspace) is version controlled. This is how your work survives container restarts.

Never force push. Always pull before pushing if there might be remote changes.
After pushing, include a link to the commit using the abbreviated hash: [abc1234](https://github.com/owner/repo/commit/abc1234) format. No backticks.

## Telegram Formatting

- **Links:** Use markdown syntax `[text](URL)` — HTML `<a href>` does NOT render

## Webhooks

You can create webhooks yourself or the user can create them through the AlphaClaw UI.

Webhook transform files must follow this convention:

- Path: hooks/transforms/{hook-name}/{hook-name}-transform.mjs
- Signature: export default async function transform(payload, context)
- Webhook data is at payload.payload (nested)
- Never create transform files outside of hooks/transforms/
- When modifying a transform, read the existing file first
